# Yelp Text Analysis

## Project Overview

Yelp Text Analysis is a project aimed at examining the impact of COVID-19 on businesses through sentiment analysis of customer reviews. By analyzing sentiment and identifying key topics in reviews, we aim to gain insights into how the pandemic has affected businesses across various industries. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to derive meaningful insights from textual data.

## Libraries and Modules

The following libraries and modules are used in this project:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computing.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For creating plots and visualizations.
- **bertopic**: For BERT-based topic modeling.
- **umap**: For dimensionality reduction using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
- **BERTopic**: For topic modeling using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

## Description

This project consists of Python scripts designed to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews extracted from Yelp. We aim to extract key themes or topics from the reviews and analyze how businesses have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining sentiments expressed in reviews and identifying topics related to the pandemic, we can better understand the challenges faced by businesses and potentially offer insights to mitigate their impact.
